This software is intended for use by [National Institute on Aging (NIA) Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers](https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dn/national-alzheimers-coordinating-center-nacc) (ADRCs) to collect data for submission to the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center ([NACC](https://naccdata.org/)) database. This data set is called UDS (Uniform Data Set). All ADRC's submit this data to contribute to the NIA's Alzheimer's Disease Longitudinal Study.

The software is implmented with .NET MVC and Entity Framework Core. You may choose to use the provided underlying data models, and a script is provided by EF Core to create the database in MS SQL 2012 or above, or other providers through EF Core packages.
